## Description

This is a web application built with Flask, a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. The application uses SQLAlchemy, an SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for Python, to interact with a MySQL database.

The application allows users to register, log in, and manage their account. It uses Flask's built-in sessions for authentication and password hashing for security.

The application's front-end is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses Flask's Jinja2 templating engine to render the views.

The application is designed to be easily deployable on any platform that supports Python and MySQL, including cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and Heroku.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/username/my-flask-project.git
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Set up the database:

    Before setting up the database, make sure you have MySQL installed and running on your machine.

    - Update the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` in `app.py` with your actual database username, password, host, and database name.

    - Initialize the database with the following command:
        ```bash
        flask db init
        ```

    - Generate an initial migration with the following command:
        ```bash
        flask db migrate -m "Initial migration."
        ```

    - Apply the migration to the database with the following command:
        ```bash
        flask db upgrade
        ```

## Usage

To run the application, use the command:
```bash
flask run
